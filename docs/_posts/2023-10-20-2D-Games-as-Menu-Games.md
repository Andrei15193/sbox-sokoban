After reading the [Retooling](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news/retooling) on the
[Sandbox](https://sbox.facepunch.com) websites I was stunned to learn that people
have implemented games using just the menu system.

Given how all the games thus far will need to be reimplemnted after the retooling
I was less inclined to resume working on the other game I had going and was very
curious on how I could implement a "menu" game.

It's probably only possible to do 2D games, or games based on images at the very
least, through this approach and this works for me as I don't have a lot of free
time to make a full 3D game. There's a lot I need to learn and experiment with
until I can make a _proper_ game. By that I mean a game I would feel good about making.

This brings me to this project, I want to keep a dev journey about what I find
and how I implement things.

Initially I was thinking about implementing Tetris since I've done that a number of
times. 1st time in C++ in highschool, a 2nd time in C++ using SFML, unsure if I
implemnted it as a desktop app in .NET with C#.

A few ideas for simple 2D games:
* Tetris
* Sudoku
* Airplanes (unsure how this can work for multiplayer, maybe with lobbies)
* Sokoban
* Any classic 2D game
* Any 2D game actually, even complex ones

I settled with making Sokoban as a "menu" game as I was already working on Sokoban 3D.

I wanted to switch to single-player games as it can be difficult to get enough players
in a co-op game or competitive game at this stage as [Sandbox](https://sbox.facepunch.com)
is in developer preview.

I'll be working on getting the 1st level of Sokoban as an MVP, this should bridge
all required components and also make it available for feedback.
